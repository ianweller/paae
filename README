This is a collaborative project to digitize Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition" into Lilypond files.

The music should closely match that of this public domain source PDF:
  http://imslp.org/wiki/Image:Moussorgsky_-_Pictures_at_an_Exhibition_-_Complete_Original_Piano_Score.pdf
Layout should differ when it makes more sense, however.

If you want to help, just send an email to <ian@ianweller.org>.
